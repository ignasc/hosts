# hosts
hosts file with certain windows domains being blocked to prevent spying and data collection.

Original video, where I got the details: [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJr2DcffquI)

The host file is located in the hard drive, where windows is installed, in the following directory (assuming windows is installed in C drive):
`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\`

P.S. always create a backup copy, just in case!
